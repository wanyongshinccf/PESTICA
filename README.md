PESETICA: physsiologoc noise esitmator using temporal ICA

How to install
Download the PESTICA package in your local and set path in your enviroment.
For example, if you download the package in /Users/wyshin/SLOMOCO
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/wyshin/SLOMOCO in bash/zsh
set (or setevn) PATH = $PATH::/Users/wyshin/SLOMOCO in csh/zcsh

AFNI and MATLAB should be installed and included in PATH
Type "afni" and "matlab" in your terminal. They should bring the program properly.
